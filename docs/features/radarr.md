## Radarr list

### Description

You can set up radarr to automatically import any movies that have been added to Movary's watchlist.

### Instruction

To do this, go to settings -> integrations -> radarr and generate a new feed URL.

Copy this URL and then go to radarr settings -> lists and click on the big plus icon to add a new list.
Scroll down and select the 'StevenLu custom' list type. Then paste the copied URL from Movary into the URL input at the bottom of the modal.

Feel free to change any other settings of the StevenLu list, it doesn't affect Movary or the watchlist.
