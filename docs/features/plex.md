Automatically track movies watched via Plex with Movary ([Plex Pass](https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/) required!).

You can generate your webhook url on the Plex integration settings page (`/settings/integrations/plex`).

Add the generated url as a [webhook to plex](https://support.plex.tv/articles/115002267687-webhooks/) to start scrobbling!

You can select what you want movary to scrobble (movie views and/or ratings) via the "Scrobble Options" checkboxes on the settings page.
