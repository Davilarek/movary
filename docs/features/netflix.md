## Import
You can import your watch history from Netflix to Movary.

Go to Netflix and find [your history](https://www.netflix.com/settings/viewed), scroll to the bottom of the page and click the `Download all` link.
You will receive a CSV file containing your watch history. 
Upload the downloaded CSV file to Movary at `/settings/integrations/netflix` to verify and edit the import data. 
Start the import with the `Import data` button.
