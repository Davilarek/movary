Movary is a self-hosted web application to track and rate your watched movies (like a digital movie diary).
You can import/export your history and ratings from/to third parties like trakt.tv or letterboxd.com,
automatically log your Plex/Jellyfin/Emby watches and much more.

Demo installation can be found [here](https://demo.movary.org/) (login email `testUser@movary.org` and password `testUser`).

**Features:**

- Movie tracking: Collect and manage your watch history and ratings
- Statistics: Overview over your movie watching behavior and history, like e.g. most watched actors/directors/genres/languages/years
- Third party support: Import and export your history and ratings from/to third partys like letterboxd.com or trakt.tv
- Plex/Jellyfin/Emby scrobbler: Automatically add new watches and ratings to Movary
- Own your personal data: Users can decide who can see their data and export/import/delete the data and their accounts at any time
- Locally stored metadata: Using e.g. themoviedb.org and imdb as sources, all metadata movary uses for your history entries can be stored locally
- PWA: Can be installed as an app ([How to install PWAs in chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9658361?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1))
- Completely free, no ads, no tracking and open source! :)

Movary has support for multiple users accounts in case you want to share your instance, but was designed with only a small number of accounts in mind.

Please report all bugs, improvement suggestions or feature wishes by creating [github issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/movary/)
or visit the [official subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/movary/)!

**Disclaimer:** This project is still in an experimental (but imo completely usable) state. I am planning to add more and improve existing features before creating a 1.0 realease,
which can lead to sudden breaking changes until then, so keep the release notes in mind when updating.
